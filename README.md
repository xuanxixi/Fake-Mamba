## ðŸ“˜ Abstract

Advances in speech synthesis intensify security threats, motivating real-time deepfake detection research. In this work, we investigate whether **bidirectional Mamba** can serve as a competitive alternative to Self-Attention in detecting synthetic speech.

We propose **Fake-Mamba**, a novel framework that combines the pretrained XLSR front-end with bidirectional Mamba blocks to capture both local and global artifacts. Our core innovation introduces three efficient encoders: TransBiMamba, ConBiMamba, and PN-BiMamba. Leveraging XLSR's rich linguistic representations, **PN-BiMamba** can effectively capture the subtle cues of synthetic speech.

Evaluated on benchmark datasets, Fake-Mamba sets new state-of-the-art results:
- ðŸ“‰ **0.97% EER** on ASVspoof2021 LA
- ðŸ“‰ **1.74% EER** on ASVspoof2021 DF
- ðŸ“‰ **5.85% EER** on In-The-Wild (ITW)

These results represent significant improvements over prior SOTA models such as XLSR-Conformer and XLSR-Mamba, while maintaining **real-time inference** across variable-length utterances. Fake-Mamba demonstrates strong generalization and practical deployment potential.
